    <p>I recently finished the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design, and javascript certificates, under this section, you will see some of the projects<br>
       I completed for that certificate, and some of the projects I did on my own. <br>

    <p>For my first project I wanted to do something to brighten the people who views its day,<br>
      and to motivate them to keep on working towards their dreams. I compiled a list of some,<br>
      of my favorite motivational quotes from people from all walks of life, and built a randomizer<br>
      application so that you can click the button, and get a new motivational quote every day.<br>
      For this project I used HTML, CSS, as the markup, and Javascript to create the randomizer<br>
      function. As far as the markup I used css grid with media queries to make the application<br>
      responsive for various screen sizes. As far as the Javascript I used Math.floor, and <br>
      Math.random() to provide a different quote for every click.

    <p>For my second project I wanted to do something that I love, and that is the future of<br>
      business. I have been selling on e-commerce sites part-time for the past couple of year<br>
      and absolutley love the fact that I can supply people with the things they want, and need<br>
      from home on my time. Also without all of the overhead, and costs that a brick and morter<br>
      store would come with. I wanted to create my own site to point my customers two, so that<br>
      I could offer better prices, and better customer service for my customers. I used html,css,<br>
      and javascript for the front end, as well as paint, and photoshop for manipulating images.<br>
      For the backend, I used Node Js, and the stripe API in order to provide a safe and streamlined<br>
      experience for my customers. As far as the styleing, I used a mixture of flexboxes, and grid<br>
      with media queries so that the pages are responsive for various screen sizes. As far as the <br>
      Javascript I used vanilla javascript in order to build several functions in order to build<br>
      the shopping cart. I needed to make the add to cart button select the item, and add the <br>
      item to the cart. At the same time, it needed to total all of the items selected, as well<br>
      as keep track of the quantity selected. I linked the stripe API to the Javascript, so that<br>
      when the customer would be ready to checkout, it would take the customer to there secure<br>
      payment processing platform, which put all of my worries about security to rest, because<br>
      stripe is a very secure API. They are actually certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1<br>
      which is the highest level of certification available in the payments industry.<br>

    <p>For this project I wanted to do something that could help to educate people, and,<br>
      to provide them with tools to help their financial wellness. I created a web application<br>
      that has calculators for some of the most important financial metrics, and educational<br>
      content about each of the financial metrics being calculated so that the user can not<br>
      only make the calculations needed to help there financial future, but they can also learn<br>
      about the metric, and how to apply it to their financial journey.For this project I used<br>
      HTML, CSS, as the markup, and Javascript to create to make the calculators functions.<br>
      As far as the markup I used css grid with media queries to make the application <br>
      responsive for various screen sizes. As far as the Javascript I used dom manipulation<br>
      in order to make the calculator buttons work, and to access the data that the user inputs.<br>
      I used a variety of mathmatical formulas for the various calculators in order to calculate<br>
      the users inputs. I also used several math functions within javascript such as Math.pow, and<br>
      and Math.round in order to make the calculations.
