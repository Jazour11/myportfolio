            position helped me learn ton's of valuable skill's such as project management,customer service, communication, and attention to detail. <br>
            I also got hand's on experience with some of Amazon's in house application's which was also great. During this experience I learned <br>
            ton's about logistic's, and supply chain.After this position I went on to a research company called Wonder research as a research<br>
            analyst. This position allowed for me to learn a varity of different skill's such excellent communication skill's, ability to adapt<br>
            to high pressure situation's, financial acuity,and data analysis, etc. This was an excellent opportunity for me to gain business, and<br>

        <h1>Academic Exerience</h1>
          <p>
            My academic journey started at Westmoreland County Community College. This was an excellent experience, and allowed for me to learn a substantial amount, 
            an afforable price. One of the many reason I choose to start my college education at a community college, is because it allowed for me to save a ton of money,
            while getting an education from great professor's that also teach at much more expensive state, and private colleges. I recived my Associates degree in Liberal
            Arts, and this allowed for me to complete all of the general education requirements that you have to complete for a bachelor's program. I then went on, and 
            transferred to the University of Pittsburgh. I learned a ton about business, and technology while attending Pitt. I majored in business management, and took 
            electives in computer science. Some of the language's I learned include Html, Css, Svg, and Javascript. I also have been self teaching these languages for the >
            last year or so. I am also learing C++. I am passionate about business, and technology, so I was able to practice my passion during my college experience. I also
            did some volunteering during my college experience. I was able to help my local Meal's on Wheels which is a charity that I feel is extremely important to any community.
            I also was recognized on the dean's list several time's throughout college.<br>
