            <p>I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg last year, and I received a bachelor's degree in Business Management. <br>
               During college I decided to take some CS courses as electives, and found out that I really enjoy technology as much as I do business.<br>
               I have experience with html, css, javascript. I recently passed my freeCodeCamp Reponsive Web Design Certificate in October, and I just<br>
               passed my freeCodeCamp Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certificate in January of 2021. I am currently working for Appen,<br> 
               as a content specialist and seeking full time employment as an entry level developer. If you would like to connect feel free to reach<br>
               out to me on my social media or through my various listed contact methods. I am always looking for new people to connect with, and I <br>
               cant wait to hear from you.

        <br>
          <p>
            Throughout college I worked, and did plenty of volunteer projects. This allowed me to gain valuable experience which helped me with work, <br>
            and academically. The first position that I held was, package delivery for Amazon in the Pittsburgh area. This position helped me learn<br>
            ton's of valuable skill's such as entrepreneurship, customer service, communication, and logistics/supply chain. I also got hand's on <br>
            experience with some of Amazon's in house application's which was also great. After this position I went on to a research company called Wonder
            Research as a research analyst. This position allowed for me to learn a varity of different skill's some of which include excellent communication
            skill's, ability to be a self starter , microsoft excel, and data analysis. This was an excellent opportunity for me to gain business, and technology
            experience. Wonder Research was a Startup at the time so I really had to learn to take initiative, and figure things out without a ton of guidance,
            which was great because it taught me to think creatively in order to figure out issues. This also sparked my interest in entreprenuership, and I learned
            so much about it from this position. After this I joined Appen which is a technology company that provides products and services in the technology industry 
            for new technologies such as machine learning, and Artifical Intelligence. Some of the skills I was able to pick up, and improve upon from this experience 
            include understanding of advanced technological concepts, data analysis, and even more improvement on my ability to be resourceful. During all of this I 
            managed my own business that sell's wholesale, and liquidation on several online marketplaces. This taught me a plethora about business, and technology. 
            Some of the valuable skill's I learned from this include digital marketing , sales, customer service, resourcefulness, and financial acuity.I also did Some
            volunteer experiences during my time at college, and these were all very rewarding expereiences, that allowed for me to serve my community, and 
            gain valueable experience. One of my favorite volunteer experiences that I was able to do to help my community, was for the murrysville Meals On Wheels.
            During this volunteer experience I helped Murrysville Meals on Wheels to expand their social media in order to attract new volunteers, and get the word,
            out to those who need the services within the community. I also put fourth efforts to try to get the drivers a gas discount from major gas stations in 
            area. This cause is very important to me because when my grandfather was really sick meals on wheels was one if the groups that helped him out during his 
            time of need. My resume which is also included on this site further expands on the experiences that I mentioned here.

          <p>
            My academic journey started at Westmoreland County Community College. This was an excellent experience, and allowed for me to learn a substantial amount, 
            for a afforable price. One of the many reason I choose to start my college education at a community college, is because it allowed for me to avoid substantial,
            debt while getting an education from great professor's that also teach at much more expensive state, and private colleges. I received my Associates degree in Liberal
            Arts, and this allowed for me to complete all of the general education requirements that you have to complete for a bachelor's program. During my time at WCCC I was able
            to learn a substanial amount about business, and the general requirements needed for a business program, which helped to set me up for success in the pursuit of my business
            degree. I also was able to do some volunteer work during this time which helped to enhance my studies, and allowed for me to serve my community in the process. I then went on, 
            and transferred to the University of Pittsburgh after receiving my associates degree. I learned a ton about business, and technology while attending Pitt. I majored in Business 
            Management, and took electives in computer science. Some of the technologies I learned include Html, Css, and Javascript. I also have been self teaching these technolgies for 
            the last year or so. During this last year I completed my freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certificate, and my Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures certificate.
            I am currently working on the freeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Certification, and I am in the process of building out a few web applications. I am also learning about backend
            development with php, and the lampstack. I am hoping to use my skills as a developer in order to find new employment,and to change the world in a dramatic way that improves 
            the lives of the many.
